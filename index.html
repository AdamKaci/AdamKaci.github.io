        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Adam Kaci, originally from Paris, France, I have lived in Los Angeles, U.S. since 2020. I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Business Administration and will concentrate in Finance. Other industries I was considering and still consider today were real estate, aerospace engineering, and airline pilot. <br><br>

        I am interested in different careers, mostly in the Finance industry. Some positions I would greatly consider are; financial analyst, financial manager, investment banking, and accountant. I am looking for any opportunities presented to me that will allow me to develop technical skills, communication skills, and build finance knowledge. <br><br>
        I currently am a member of the Future Business Leaders of America. I am part of the outreach committee whose goal is to bring more students to the organization and reach out to companies and graduate students to learn more about the professional environment. Developed my analytical skills through case studies in partnership with other clubs. Improved my communication skills and knowledge about different elements such as investing, and how to use different software. <br><br>
        Some previous work experience I have is tutoring. I have tutored different middle-school students for 2 years, from August 2021 to June 2023. I am a French native speaker and competent in mathematics, so the two subjects I mostly helped students with were Mathematics and French. I created games, organized reading assignments, and made students participate in discussions so they could improve their writing, speaking, and reading French skills. For mathematics, I created exercises that were similar to what students were learning so they could learn and be more comfortable during exams. <br><br>
        I led a school group project in which the goal we chose was to bring the most toys we could in 4 months to children in the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. To achieve this goal we decided to divide our toy collection into two parts. One consisted of donations made by other students, the other was to buy them with money we would collect. We started with a $200 investment which we used to buy snacks. We then sold our goods and after 2 months of reselling, we made a profit of about $1,200. Our whole profit was used to buy toys which were given to children before the start of winter break. <br><br>
        I also was a school representative during my 2 last years of high school. I was studying in an International School, following the French curriculum and these last 2 years were important as the final exam in 12th grade highlights what a student has learned and accomplished during school. As a class representative, I assisted the class in resolving issues with different teachers and proposed solutions to better use class time and allow everyone to excel during this week of exams.<br><br>
        Skills: Fluent in French, Time-management skills, Problem-solving, Competent in mathematics
